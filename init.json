Heck, even the ATX cables are so big. The ATX cables alone fill the ViCase housing leaving no space for anything else. The solution are Pico ATX Power Supplies. The power supply itself is made tiny by using modern, high efficiency, high density (read expensive) power circuits. And the space consuming cables are done away completely, buy soldering the power supply PCB directly to the ATX connector. Problem solved. Unfortunately you now need two Power Supplies: 1) AC/DC Adapter 2) Pico ATX Power aka ViCase-Power. This makes the power supply of the Mini Computer more expensive versus a standard Desktop. In turn you get a much smaller and much more quiet PC."

A specialized PCIe card could accelerate your application > 1000% when compared to your CPU. This makes adding a PCIe Card the most efficient method to speed up your PC. Dedicated PCIe cards can be expensive. This brings us to the second use case of ViDock: Share expensive cards with more than one PC."

The lowest Intel CPU choice is 35 W. But since the Motherboard chip is integrated in AMD AM1 and not integrated in Intel CPUs your power consumption comparison is 12 W versus 48W. Keep in mind though that maximum performance of Entry AMD line is limited to about the performance level of a tablet. In some countries Entry AMD is half the cost for motherboard and CPU when compared to Entry Intel. In other countries the cost is the same. This motherboard directly supports UHD = 4k Display. Only at 30 Hz, but will be sufficient for high end picture frame. Paired with ViCase Tiny you get a Mini or All-In-One PC of lowest cost, lowest power consumption with good looks. Using standard Desktop components will allow you to upgrade only parts when needed and keep it operational for decades to come. The very low power consumption allows for passive cooling and makes this PC practically maintenance free."

Great foundation for a mid range PC, including decent gaming when paired with a GPU. The LGA 1150 CPU socket supports a huge range of intel CPU up to the very fast i7 Quad Core 4790. This means you will have plenty of room to upgrade your CPU later if so desired. You can build computer with this motherboard that will be snappy at everything you throw at them, except for high end demanding applications."

We use this in the high end configurations to give you very large Data Disks at speed levels similar to SSD and security even beyond. 2) NVME-M2: This port is 600% faster than SATA 3. A dramatic improvement. 3) 32 GB DDR4. You can use more memory and it is 40% faster than DDR3. 4) New CPU Socket 1151: It gives you all these cool features and makes your board future proof. 5) Integrated 4K Display support: Connect the latest 4K display without the need to add a GPU card. 6) Build in WiFi. 7) If you are looking for the fastest PC possible, choose this board with confidence. ViCase comes with the matching CPU cooling solution, so you can run even the biggest CPU at 100% load all the time without thermal throttling. The V²Configurator has high end configurations to turn all these extras into a much faster computer for you."

You can even turn off one of the two cores and the whole system will use 6W only at full load. Ideal for a general purpose low cost PC or for a presentation PC, such as a large size 28\" picture frame to replace an A2 printer or presentation displays in meeting rooms, lobby, hotels, etc. The very low power consumption allows the use of a passive cooler, which makes this PC completely maintenance free and literally silent when paired with an SSD. Performance will feel like a decent tablet. Recommended OS Ubuntu. It also may serve as a streaming PC for Gaming or Video. Be aware that in some countries an Intel Celeron CPU is lower cost and at the same time faster."

This CPU will give you a very snappy Office / General Purpose PC. The power budget is still very small with 25W in total, which leads to additional savings in power supply and CPU cooler. Bear in mind that this is the fastest CPU that you can plug into the Entry Motherboard. If you plan on growing the performance of your PC, then you will be better served with the Mid Range Motherboard. But if you are looking for lowest cost, low power consumption HTPC / Office PC, this is the best value — with quite a margin."

This CPU uses the same LGA 1150 socket. This means you can replace this CPU at a later time even with an i5 or i7 Quad Core. Enough room to grow.

The i5-6500 CPU comes with the newly released LGA 1151 socket with the key benefit to support DDR4, which at the same price is twice as fast as DDR3.

High Profile Modules may collide with the Cooler-L, depending on your Motherboard layout. As always, if you do not want to be troubled with such details, use the Wizard of the V²Configurator. All our ready made configurations using High Profile Memory Modules use the ViCase-Cooler-XL to ensure conflict free assembly for you. Its more expensive design based on heat pipes allows for larger memory modules. To make life simple, all DDR3 memory modules we selected are Low Profile and all DDR4 Modules are High Profile. This makes for straight forward paring: DDR3 with ViCase-Cooler-L and DDR4 with ViCase-Cooler-XL."

If however you want to store large amounts of data, say photos, videos, etc..., then we recommend your Data to be stored on a second HDD for cost reasons. Using RAID 5 technology, you can make HDD quite save and fast. More about that in the Article ???How to choose your Data Disk???"
